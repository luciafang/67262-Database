# Database Project - Phase 2

### Overview
This repository contains the artifacts for Phase 2 of our database project for the Fall 2023 Database Design course. Our goal is to transform the conceptual model developed in Phase 1 into a relational and physical model to implement a fully functional database system.
### Features
Updated Conceptual Model: Refinements based on Phase 1 feedback and additional requirements.
Relational Model: A detailed relational schema representing our database structure.
Normalization: Ensuring data integrity through normalization up to BCNF.
Physical Model: Implementation details using Vertabelo for physical database design.
SQL Scripts: Scripts for database creation, schema definition, and data manipulation.
Python Scripts: Utility scripts to interact with the database, implementing user stories.
### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: git clone [repository-url]
2. Install required Python packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set up your database using the SQL scripts provided in the sql directory.
4. Populate the database with initial data from the data directory CSV files.
5. Run Python scripts in the scripts directory to test user story implementations.

### Project Structure
/conceptual_model: Updated ER diagrams and conceptual models.
/relational_model: Relational schema files and documentation.
/sql: SQL scripts for database setup and initial data loading.
/data: Sample data files in CSV format.
/scripts: Python scripts for executing database queries and operations.
/documentation: Additional project documentation and user stories.
